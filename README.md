# 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons' Companion App

A React Native mobile app that acts as a companion for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. An MVP is currently in review to be released on the Google Play Store and I am continually adding new features.

Currently, users can: fill out a profile of their town; add residents and view all available villagers; search for bugs and fish available at different times; track DIY recipes; and track Museum progress. Upcoming features include a checklist for daily tasks, an in-game stock market tracker, and guides for various in-game features such as flower breeding. The UI is based on the in-game mobile device with additional assets I created.
